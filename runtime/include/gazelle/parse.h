 *    with more data, or you may call gzl_finish_parse() if the input has
 *    reached EOF.
 *  - GZL_STATUS_ERROR: there was a parse error in the input.  The parse state
 *    is as it immediately before the erroneous character or token was
 *    encountered, and can therefore be used again if desired to continue the
 *    parse from that point.  state->offset will reflect how far the parse
 *    proceeded before encountering the error.
 *  - GZL_STATUS_CANCELLED: a callback that was called inside of gzl_parse()
 *    requested that parsing halt.  state is now invalid (this may change for
 *    the better in the future).
 *  - GZL_STATUS_HARD_EOF: all or part of the buffer was parsed successfully,
 *    but a state was reached where no more characters could be accepted
 *    according to the grammar.  state->offset reflects how many characters
 *    were read before parsing reached this state.  The client should call
 *    gzl_finish_parse() if it wants to receive final callbacks.
 *  - GZL_STATUS_RESOURCE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: a resource limit like maximum stack
 *    depth or maximum lookahead limit was exceeded.
